# Rational behind

### The considerations behind the selections:
- Only recently active members are eligible
- Part time paid members in one category (e.g. community) can be placed for another contribution on another category (e.g. tech)
- Nominations without reason and/or without amount could not be taken into account
- If the Computors approve our selection we may do another round later

### The Selection Jury: Gandalf, El Clip, JOETOM
We did a selection and let the community vote. The current list has been approved by the community.
If approved, El Clip will act as escrow to distribute the funds to the selected members.
