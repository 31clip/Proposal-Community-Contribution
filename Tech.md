# Rational behind

### The considerations behind the selections:
- Only recently active members are eligible
- Part time paid members in one category (e.g. community) can be placed for another contribution on another category (e.g. tech)
- Nominations without reason and/or without amount could not be taken into account
- If the Computors approve our selection we may do another round later

### The Selection Jury: Gandalf, El Clip, JOETOM
We did a selection and let the community vote. The current list has been approved by the community.
